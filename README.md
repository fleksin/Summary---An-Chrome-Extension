# Summary---An-Chrome-Extension
An extension to show summary when mouse over a link in website

To use this extension, you will need to have chrome.

When installed with this extension, a additional window will show up when you move your mouse over a link.

The window will show the link's basic information, which are the largest picture and some paragraphs(I only acquired the first 5 p nodes).
